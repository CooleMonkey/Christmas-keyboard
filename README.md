# Christmas-keyboard
I will tell you something about my project. As the title already says, it's a christmas themed keyboard. I made the size 60/65% and I added a numpad to the left cause I hate it when the numpad to the right is in the way of my mouse.
So that's also the first reason why I made this project. The second reason is that I wanted to challenge myself during my holliday, instead of speningd hours and hours gaming and I definitely challenged myself.
The third reason was the fact that the best christmas themed project shipped before monday 5 januari 2026 would get a 3d-printer. That was a great motivation for me to start this project, cause I really want a 3d-printer.

During this project I had some struggles with the PCB and the 3d-case, but eventually I got everyhting the right way I wanted it, so I'm pretty happy when I'm looking back at the time I have spent into this project.
