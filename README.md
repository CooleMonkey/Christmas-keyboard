# Christmas-keyboard
I will try to make a custom christmas keyboard cause I wanna try to make my own keyboard.
Beside that, I don't like my current 100% keyboard cause the numpad is in the way.
So my plan is to make a 60% keyboard and move the numpad to the lefthand side, so that I can use my mouse and numpad at the same time.
