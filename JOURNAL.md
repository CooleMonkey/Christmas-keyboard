I started looking for a layout for the keyboard and found this. The base will be this, but I will add a numpad to the left cause I wanna control my mouse with my right hand.
So this way I can use my mouse and numpad at the same time and my numpad isn't in the way of my mouse.

Just finished the first part of my layout, but still working on it. Cause it takes some time and I wanna add lights.

I added some lights and found out that I had forgotten a row so and then I wired everything up.

The keyboard is slowly coming to life. Just started with wiring everything up.
I started this project today at 18:00 and around 3 hours of work later I arrived at the wiring, but still a lot has to be done. Btw I took a 20 minute break to eat from 19:40 to 20:00.

# 30-12-2025 21:50
Finally done with the wiring. Spend about 3.5 hours today.

Started thinking about the 3d case design. Cause not every 3d printer can support a 40 cm wide keyboard. So I need to break it up into some parts.
My plan is to break the case up into 2 sides. Those sides will overlap at a specific point and there will be a hole in that overlap, so that I can screw them together.

# 31-12-2025 14:30
Still working on the right bottom part of the case. The hardest struggle was getting all the dimensions right.

# 31-12-2025 15:30
Right bottom case is almost done. Just needs some finishing touches and screw holes for the pcb. I also still need to think about how I'm gonna make sure the pcb won't move. Option 1 is screwing, but I don't really like that, but that is probably the best option I have.

# 31-12-2025 18:30
Don't ask me how, but I just spend a whole hour trying to get the right 3d model for the keyswitches in KiCad.
Total hours spend is now 6.5 and I'm estimating this will be at least 10 when I'm done with everything.
I'm planning to do the bottom left case tomorrow and then I will check the 3d case with the 3d pcb to check if all proportions are right.
If all the proportions are right, then I will proceed with the upper part of the case.

It's the first day of 2026 and I made some improvements to the pcb board and right bottom case in half an hour. On the right bottom case I rounded the corners and made the hole for the usb end of the raspberry pi pico a bit larger. On the PCB I made the first 2 holes to screw to pcb to the case and I moved some wires more to the inside to make sure they won't be damaged by the screws.

# 1-1-2026 13:00
Time is going so fast when I'm having fun. Just put another hour into this project. The bottom left case is almost done. When that's completely done I will make the last screw holes in the PCB and start working on the Upper part of the case.

Another hour has gone by and the Upper right case is done. It's very entertaining to see your vision slowly coming to life.

# 1-1-2026 18:30
After 2 hours the full upper case is done. In my opion it looks really good. The only thing left for me to do in CAD is color the 5 different parts. Tonight or tomorrow I will write the firmware for the keyboard.

# 1-1-2026 21:30
It took my a stunning 1,5 hours and some help of chatgpt to write the code. I thought I had found a great youtube video with explanation, but when it was almost at the end I found out I couldn't use that way, so than I had to start all over again. But anyway, my code should work now.

# 1-1-2026 23:00
Just made some small cute cuts in the top part of the case.

I've added BOM and all the files. Everything if finally done. I'm pretty proud of this project.

# 8-1-2026 9:00
My keyboard got reviewed last night and I had to change some things. The first thing is that some of the PCB wires didn't look good and that I should use 45 degree angels instead of 90 degree angles. So I just fixed the PCB. I also changed the BOM a little bit, cause I forgot to add the screws to mount the PCB to the case. I won't maken screw holes in the case to mount to PCB for the case cause I can do that later on with some special tools, so that way I can make sure the PCB fits in it's place.
BTW, this cost me 30 minutes.

# 8-1-2026 9:30
After another 30 minutes of working everything should now be fixed. I made it so that I can screw the M3 16mm screws from the bottom and that there is enough room for the head of the screw to 'dissapear in the case'.
