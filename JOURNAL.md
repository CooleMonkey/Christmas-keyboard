I started looking for a layout for the keyboard and found this. The base will be this, but I will add a numpad to the left cause I wanna control my mouse with my right hand.
So this way I can use my mouse and numpad at the same time and my numpad isn't in the way of my mouse.

Just finished the first part of my layout, but still working on it. Cause it takes some time and I wanna add lights.

I added some lights and found out that I had forgotten a row so and then I wired everything up.
